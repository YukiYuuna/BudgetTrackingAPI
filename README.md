Hello and welcome to my first self-made API! ✌

First of all, I would love to tell you a little bit about the idea and why I invested so much time into this project. As I am a CS university student, each semester we have the task to create a project based on the things we learn throughout  those 3-5 months. Well, this semester our assignment as to build an API. I saw this as a great opportunity to improve my skills in Java, as well as learn how to work with Spring! With that being said, as well as the fact that I am kind of obsessed with tracking my expenses, the idea of a Budget Tracking API appeared!

# 📝 What I've learned and improved:
✔ I have considerably improved my skills in working with an array 😉 of Data Structures.
✔ Object-Relational Mapping and general workflow with databases (mainly PostgreSQL🐘)
✔ Working with Spring 🍃 and lots of its features, including Spring Security🔐 , Spring Boot and many more.
✔  How to work with JWT tokens (more spec. OAuth tokens).
✔ The concepts of Authorization & Authentication as well as implementing them.
✔ Learned and implemented as much as possible the RESTful principles.
✔ Bettered my understanding on the concept of abstraction.
✔ Learned how to write complex JUnit Tests📝, using a BDD approach and utilizing tools like Mockito and MockMvc.
✔ Improved my skills with Version Control (Git).

## Enough rambling😅, lets talk about the API⬇

# Technologies and Versions I've used
* Java SDK - version: 17
* Spring Boot Framework, Spring Security - version: 2.6.0
* PostgreSQL - version: 42.3.1
* JWT (Auth0) - version: 3.18.2
* Lombok - version: 1.18.22

# 💻 Setting up and running the API on your local machine:
1. First, make sure you have your java and maven versions configured correctly on your machine.
2. Run:
& git clone <copy & paste the HTTP URL from GitHub>
.. in a place on your computer, where you find comfortable.
3. Setup the  'application.properties' based on your PostgreSQL and localhost details.
4. At this point, you should be able to run the 'ExpenseTrackerApplication.main' and with that start the API. 🥳
